<h1 align="center">Job Track</h1>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce50ecd0-7be1-44f6-a9a5-4655ec280094)

A single page application to record and track your job applications at ease. Check out the app [here](https://job-track-9c538.web.app/).

## Motivation
The traditional way of using Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets to track job applications is boring and depressing. I wanted an aesthetic way to add, search and update job applications quickly during job hunting season. Hence, Job Track was borned!

Job Track started out as a project for my colleague module. After graduating, I continue to maintain and improve the application in my free time. Hope that you find it as useful as I do!
